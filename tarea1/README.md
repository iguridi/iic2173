This app is running in a server hosted in Google Compute Engine

The url of the web app is [this](http://t1iic2173.appspot.com/)

It was based on:

- [Golang tutorial](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/)

- The last two commands of a [Compute Engine quickstart tutorial](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?project=t1iic2173&folder&organizationId=710988912831&tutorial=compute_quickstart)

- The view template on this [example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/golang-samples/blob/8deb2909eadf32523007fd8fe9e8755a12c6d463/appengine/gophers/gophers-4/main.go)

- And used the tutorial Using PostgreSQL with Go, a series which starts with this [article](https://www.calhoun.io/how-to-install-postgresql-9-5-on-ubuntu-16-04/). It goes from the basics of installing and setting up Postgres to more Go related actions like querying multiple rows using the Go sql package.
